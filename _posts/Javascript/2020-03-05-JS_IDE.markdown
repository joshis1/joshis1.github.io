This article is all about setting up visual studio code for Javascript development.
Here are the important settings that will help us for javascript programming.

The first step here is to install nodejs.
If you are using Ubuntu, then you could do

{% highlight ruby %}
$sudo apt-get install nodejs
{% endhighlight %}

In this article, I will share a lot of screen shots that will help to identify what we are trying to do.

**Extensions**
Just like marketplace in eclipse, visual studio uses the terminology extensions.
You could download a lot of packages from extension. Here is extension.

**LiveServer extension**

We would not like to stop and start the application all the time in order to see the results.
This 'LiveServer' extension will read the code on the fly and there is no need to restart the application.
All the changes will be picked by the liveserver. This is a very handy extension. Here is the picture to 
download the liveserver.

**Use Standard Javascript version i.e. ECMA 6**

This will help to auto complete the code and use the standard ES version 6 javascript.

Here is the screen shot

**Auto Close tag**

This will help to automatically close the tag.
Here is the description about it.

**Auto rename tag**

This will help to automatically rename the closing or opening tag when
you change one of the tag. Here is the description about it.

**babel ES6/ES7**

This will help to highlight the grammar error in the code like wrong
variable names, etc. Here is the description, its better to keep the code good and meaningful.

**Settings that will help your project**

a) Auto Save the changes  - after certain delay.

b) wordwrap turn to on - so that the long line falls back to next line.

c) code-runner.clearPreviousOutput: true - so that you don't have to clear the terminal output all the time manually.

Here is the working example code that runs on the IDE.

Also, you could use the run and debug button to run the code.

I have run all my examples on ubuntu 18.04.
