This article is all about “Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern.” This pattern
falls under the category of “Behavioural Pattern.”

**Difference between Structural and Behavioural Pattern**
1. Structural Pattern talks about the relationship between entities. For
example, Façade Pattern and Adapter Pattern.

2. Behavioural Pattern talks about how these entities communicate with each
other. For example, Strategy Pattern and Observer Pattern.
In the “Chain of Responsibility Principle”, we talk about how the command from
the client is delegated from one object to another. This talks about how the
message is delegated ( communicated) from one object to another. A chain
of responsibility decouples the sender and receiver. A sender will just post the
command on the pipeline. The objects which are connected to the pipeline will
either process the desired command or will just delegate to their next object.

**Task:**
A STB will receive the XMPP commands, the commands are for various
sub-modules. For example, reboot the box – by Power Manager of the box,
HDD health – by Storage Manager of the box, and code download – by the
Software Upgrade Manager of the box. Also, we need scalability so that if any
other module/requirement comes, then there is no code change required.

**Solution/Discussion:**
These entities are totally disconnected. For example,
Power Manager and Storage Manager have entirely different purpose. We
don’t want sender to be coupled with the receiver. The sender can just
dispatch the message/command to the pipeline and forget. The object that is
connected to the pipeline will either process or delegate the command to the
next object. In order to synthesis this kind of behavior, we need to implement
'Chain of Responsibility' principle.

A ‘Chain of Responsibility’ principle implements a singly linked list. Here, all the objects are connected with each other. A message/command is dispatched to
the head node of the singly linked list. If the head node cannot handle the
command/message, then it will delegate to its next object . This way, the
message/command is delegated from one node to another unless the
message can be handled by the appropriate object.

__Chain of Responsibility__

**How to implement the behavioural pattern to realise ‘Chain of
Responsibility’ design pattern here?**

1. XMPP command Enums – All the commands that can be supported by the
STB system. We can always extend it.

2. XMPP Stanza – This is the base class – head node for the chain of
responsibility principle i.e. singly linked list. A command/message will always be dispatched first to this head node of the pipeline. If the message cannot be handled, then it will call it’s next object to handle it. This way, the message will be delegated to next object unless the message can be handled. This class should have a routine/method to build the singly linked list i.e next pointer.
A client will dispatch the XMPP commands to this class object only. Also, it will
register itself with this class. Internally, during registration, it will append the new object into its singly linked list. Also, this class will have a
virtual method to handle the message. This class will just delegate the message to its next object .

3. XMPP – pipeline objects – These can be extended easily. For the given
problem, the XMPP pipeline objects are – codeDownProcessor,
hddDiagnosticsProcessor, and rebootStbProcessor. Each of these objects
will implement the virtual method to handle the message. If any of the object
cannot handle the message, then it will call the head node/super class/base
class to delegate the message to its next object.

4. client – The client will create all the pipeline objects and the base object i.e. XMPP Stanza. All the pipeline objects will be registered with the head node i.e. XMPP Stanza. As discussed earlier, during registration, the head node/base
class will append the pipeline object to its singly linked list.

Here is the code for each class.
